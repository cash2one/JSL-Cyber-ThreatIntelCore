#Malware Black List


## Summary
This dataset parses known malicious data sources, shown by their IP address and/or Register Domain name, and focuses on the following Black List:

Malware Blacklists
Malware Patrol & Malware URL provide block lists of compromised websites and regular updates regarding the latest domains with malicious activity. They trawl the web, looking for malicious URLs. They then list malware-infected websites in fully downloadable block lists for consumers to peruse.


## Description
This data set includes information generated from Malware Blacklists.

Malware Blacklists contain lists of URLs hosting harmful software designed specifically to disrupt or damage a computer system. Examples of such malware are viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware. 

This data has been generated using the above mentioned Malware Blacklists, from which ip addresses and domains have been scraped, as well as any other available information. The output has in turn been enriched by WhoIs information, obtained by querying data from one of the Regional Internet Registries, for each ip/domain: 

(1) American Registry for Internet Numbers—ARIN: Responsible for the administration of Internet addresses and domains for North America, including Canada, the United States and portions of the Caribbean.
(2) Rseaux IP Europens Network Coordination Centre—RIPE NCC: Responsible for the administration of Internet addresses and domains for Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. RIPE NCC is considered the first official registry—the United States government was still too busy being actively involved with managing Internet addressing for much of North America 
at that time, and therefore was not first.
(3) The Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre—APNIC: Responsible for the administration of Internet addresses and domains for Asia and the Pacific Rim. Founded in Tokyo, Japan, APNIC was the second RIR to be established. APNIC relocated to Brisbane, 
Australia, in 1998.
(4) Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry—LACNIC: Responsible for the administration of Internet addresses and domains for Latin America and the Caribbean. Headquartered in Montevideo, Uruguay.
(5) The African Network Information Centre—AfriNIC: Responsible for the administration of Internet addresses and domains for the African continent. Based in Ebene City, Mauritius, AfriNIC became operational in 2005.

## Schema
- IP_Address
  - IP address of an entry in the blacklist.
  - Type: String

- Listing_date
  - Date of listing. This could be the date of a single entry, or an entire collection of entries.
  - Type: Date

- Host_Name String   DataSource Scrape Data
  - A host name is a name that is assigned to a host that uniquely identifies it on a network and thus allows it to be addressed without using its full IP address.
  - Type: String

- Autonomous_System_Number
  - An autonomous system number (ASN) is a unique number that's available globally to identify an autonomous system and which enables that system to exchange exterior routing information with other neighboring autonomous systems. The number of autonomous system numbers is limited. For autonomous system numbers to be assigned, current guidelines need the network to be multi-homed and have a unique routing policy. Autonomous system numbers can be assigned only through a request to the local Internet registry.
